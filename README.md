# pomodoro-timer README

Use the pomodoro method while coding in VSCode to help stay focused, track your progress, and manage your time. Work for 25 minutes and then take a short break, and a longer break after finishing four work sessions.


## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/extension_statusbar_screenshot.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

Configure the Pomodoro Timer using the following settings:

* `condensedDisplay`: Show a number representing today's earned Pomodoros, instead of a set of images.
* `pomodoroDuration`: Work session duration in minutes (default is 25 minutes)
* `shortBreakDuration`: Short break duration in minutes (default is 5 minutes)
* `longBreakDuration`: Long break duration in minutes (default is 15 minutes)
* `pomodorosPerLongBreak`: Set how many pomodoros you will need to earn before you take a longer break (default is 4)
